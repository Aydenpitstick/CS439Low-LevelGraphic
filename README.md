I used python and Tkinter to create an image with code.
Tkinter in python has a canvas element that things are drawn on. Once the canvas is initialized it can be used to display things that are drawn on it using other Tkinter methods.
I learned that graphics can be created directly within the code and don’t have to be pulled from an image file.
